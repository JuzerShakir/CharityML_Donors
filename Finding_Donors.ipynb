    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

The commercial web search engines [Yahoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo) and [Yahndex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yandex) use variants of gradient boosting in their machine learned ranking engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strenghts: ** The strengths of this model are that it builds new trees which complement the already built trees. The new trees which will be built will help to correct errors in the previously built trees. This can produce highly accurate results with less trees. Its quite powerful and also better than random forest classifier. \n",

    "**Strenghts: ** Unlike SVM or other power classifiers, AdaBoost can achieve similar classification result with much less tweaking or settings. Its fast and also less prone to over fit.\n",

It also doesn't overfit the data since we have a good accuracy score in training set of approx 85% and we see similar accuracy score in testing set too which means it does a very good job of predicting who makes more than \\$50k with given set of features. Same argument I can make about underfitting, which it doesn't do at all.\n",
    "Talking about the f-score now, it is nearly around 80% which is highest among other algorithms. The higher the f-score, the greater the models prediction and recall which are surely important for our data. \n",

    "As far as time goes, GBC does take the longest time to train but it does a real nice and fast job when it comes to prediction. AdaBoost Classifier takes the shortest time to train but when it comes to prediction, it takes the longest. Though, it also does a pretty well job in accuracy and f-score both in training and testing set but GBC takes is better in accuracy and f-score and also when it comes to model prediction time. The time taken by GBC while training the model does go high as our training set increases. It's a little trade-off we make here if we want better prediction results."

    "**Answer: ** You can think of Machine Learning (ML) as a methodology of statistical guessing, of which there are many algorithms. GBC is a type of **Tree Model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Tree model is, in layman’s terms, like the Twenty Questions guessing game. The guesser might have questions like “Is it bigger than a bread box?”, “Is it alive?”, etc. The size or lifeness of the thing being guessed at is a “feature”. By winnowing down what is likely or unlikely based on these questions, you end up with a likely (but possibly wrong) answer. Part of the strategy in 20 questions is to order the questions correctly: the first few questions should be broad, so as to eliminate large number of possibilities. The last few questions should be more specific to hone in on the “best” possible answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what happens when a Tree ML is trained on the data set, the algorithm tries to come up with a set of “questions” that are ‘optimal”. Unfortunately, there is no perfect solution. So, there are different strategies to try to build the Tree Model. GBC is one of the Tree models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GBC:**\n",
    "Imagine 20 teams (trees). A boss at the top, then subordinates, then more  subordinates, and so on. Team members are explanatory variables. Assume,  `Trees = 20` and `Depth (number of members in each team) = 5`. So each team  will have 5 members, and total members = 100. We give them a book to  read, and then they will have to answer 20 questions (Number of  observations in our data). Assume they have binary answers: Yes or No (in our case, less than 50k or greater).  Now, we start the process. The aim of the process is to maximum correct answers by building 20 teams having 5 members each. Any member can be a  part of more than 1 team, and any member can have more than 1 more than 1  role in same team. The member which have maximum roles is the most important variable of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The  process starts with a random guess of answers. Then it `calculates error = Actual - Predicted Answer`. Next step, it build a team of 5  members, which reduces the error by maximum. Again, it calculates the  error. The second team (tree) has to reduce it further. But next team  doesn't trust its previous partner fully, so it assume that answers are correct with x probability (learning rate). This process go on till 20 teams are build. So in the process, we have to decide, how many teams to  build (trees), members in each team(depth) and learning team, so that error in the end is minimum. This can only be done by trial and error method.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "A gradient boosting model is a **CHAIN** of decision trees that also each make a vote. But instead of each learning in isolation, when you add a new one to the chain, it tries to improve a bit on what the rest of the chain already thinks. So, a new tree’s decision is influenced by all the trees that have already voiced an opinion. When you add a new tree to a GBC, it gets to see what its predecessors thought - and how they got it right or wrong. They then formulate a suggestion to correct the errors of their predecessors - and then they add that to the pot, and then the process continues with the next tree you add to the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "It requires three things, a loss/error function, a weak learning model, and an additive model. First we start by finding the loss or error function for the problem. In our case the loss function is logarithmic (since we are dealing with classification problem). Next, we use decision trees to create numerous 'weak' learning models. 'Weak learners' are models that are slightly better than chance, meaning that the model will predict correctly slightly more than 50% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a large number of decision trees that are simple to build and run, we move onto our additive model function. The GBC model looks at each individual decision tree created and will add together the trees to create a single modeled tree with the lowest possible loss/error. Every node, every branch, every level is analyzed and the additive model will help to create the most efficient model possible.\n",

    "### Implementation: Model Tuning\n",
    "Fine tune the chosen model. Use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) with at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values. You will need to use the entire training set for this. In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",
    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",
    "- Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_fit`.\n",

How much wealthy they are doesn't matter, when someone is loosing assets or having huge losses, its difficult to say that they will donate.\n",

    "**Answer:** I am quite surprised that I got almost all right except for one which is 'hours-per-week'. I didn't except this to be on top 5 and I am also stunned that 'Occupation' is no where to be seen in top 5 since i had made bold confident statements above. And it also seems age is a crucial factor here, though I had mentioned it in my top 5, i didnt expected to be so high based on my inituition. Numbers and data don't lie, 'age' having more influence than 'capital-gain' is quite surprising."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "- As we can see, reduced data gives us reduced accuracy and F_score. It's about 3 percent decrease in accuracy and about 5 percent in F-score. \n",
    "- Feeding full `censes data` to Optimized GDC takes obviously more time than feeding reduced `censes data`. It took about 5-10 min to model full censes data and it took seconds for reduced data. \n",
    "- Now, When it comes to accuracy and F-score, we are trading off crucial scores when we feed less data which takes very less time to model but when we feed full data we do end up getting better results with slightly higher time rate. Its a simple trade off we make here, if we want it quick, we would feed reduced data, hence ending up with lower accuracy and fscore and the opposite argument I would make for full data.\n",
    "- I personally would stick to feeding full data. Since it doesn't take much longer time to model full data than reduced data, the important thing we get here is better scores. Once modeled, classifier can classify results instant. So a one time trade-off of time , gives us a lifetime of better results."
